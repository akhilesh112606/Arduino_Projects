### Project 1: DHT11 Sensor with I2C LCD

This project demonstrates how to use the **DHT11** sensor to read temperature and humidity and display the results on an **I2C LCD** using Arduino.

## Components Needed
- **DHT11 Sensor**
- **I2C LCD (16x2)**
- **Arduino Board**
- **Jumper Wires**

## Wiring
- **DHT11**: 
  - VCC to 5V or 3.3V
  - GND to GND
  - DATA to Pin 2
- **I2C LCD**: 
  - VCC to 5V
  - GND to GND
  - SDA to A4
  - SCL to A5

## Libraries
- **SimpleDHT**: To read data from the DHT11 sensor.
- **LiquidCrystal_I2C**: To control the I2C LCD.
